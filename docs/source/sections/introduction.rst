Introduction

Ecstasy is a Python package and markup language that makes your command-line tool so much more beautiful and pretty. It works by parsing a specially marked-up string and inserting command-line-specific escape-sequences that alter the strings appearance by giving it pretty colors, underlining it, making it blink, turning it bold or dim or even hiding it. When printed to a command-line, these escape-sequences are then interpreted appropriately and the originally hideous string is suddenly all marvelous and pretty.
